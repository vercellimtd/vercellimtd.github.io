The Archiving Out of the Box team supports community storytelling with a  digital archiving and storytelling kit. This demo site has examples of 3 different kinds of community contributions: scanned/screencaptured documents, photos of objects, and vidoes.

Visit our main site for information on how to build relationships, hold community-storytelling collection events, build the collection using our template site, and use community stories for practical community-improvement projects.

Our team got its start at the [Institute for Digital Arts and Humanities](https://idah.indiana.edu/) at Indiana University Bloomington and is now funded by the [Digital Justice Development Grant program at the American Council on Learned Societies](https://www.acls.org/recent-fellows/?program_id=40090&_project_year=2024).
